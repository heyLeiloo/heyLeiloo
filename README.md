👩🏻‍💻 I'm a Game Designer, Concept Artist, Animator — and the creator of Shark’s Request, a colorful adventure platformer that's my biggest and proudest project so far.

🎮 Over the years, I’ve learned a lot about crafting worlds, telling stories, and building experiences through games, art, and animation. Every idea comes to life one brushstroke, pixel, and keyframe at a time.

🌟 I run heyleiloo.com, where I post my games, my art, and my blog. On the blog, I teach through detailed, easy-to-follow guides about Unity, Procreate, Painter, Photoshop, Maya, and more — helping artists, game devs, and creative dreamers bring their visions to life.

🦈 Shark’s Request is the heart of my creative journey — a vibrant, adventurous platformer that brings together everything I love about game design: colorful worlds, compelling stories, and pure creative energy.

💖 As a Game Designer and artist, my mission is to inspire others to dream big, create boldly, and bring their own ideas to life. I’m building worlds, telling stories, and living the creative life — and I’d love for you to join me on this journey.
